# Cheatsheets
This is my own effort to collate helpful cheatsheets and references that I've found incredibly useful. Most have been either created or copied over the years. Mostly in pdf/md format, but otherwise I'll try to make them as accessible as possible on all platforms.

This list will be updated regularly, so watch this space :)

Also happy to accept any contributions! Do send a PR or file an issue if you find any errata.
